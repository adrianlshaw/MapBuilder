You may do this by foot, but it can be very tiring, as I have found out!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/alshaw/MapBuilder/raw/master/res/drawable-hdpi/icon.png\" alt=\"MapBuilder\" />\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Special thanks to\r\n\r\n[Dr Thomas Chothia](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~tpc/home.html)","tagline":"Developed alongside BhamNav, this application creates custom maps in the form of KML files, which can be used in the BhamNav application to create other university maps.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
